  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <div id="abstract">
  <p>Previous research in pattern formation using reaction-diffusion mostly focused on static domains, either for
     computational simplicity or mathematical tractability. In this work, we have explored the expressiveness of 
     combining simple mechanisms as a possible explanation for pigmentation pattern formation, where tissue growth 
     plays a crucial role.</p>

  <p>Our motivation is not only to realistically reproduce natural patterns but also to get insights into the underlying
     biological processes. Therefore, we present a novel approach to generate realistic animal skin patterns. First, we
     describe the approximation of tissue growth by a series of discrete matrix expansion operations. Then, we combine it
     with an adaptation of Turingâ€™s non-linear reaction-diffusion model, which enforces upper and lower bounds to the
     concentrations of the involved chemical reagents. We also propose the addition of a single-reagent continuous
     autocatalytic reaction, called reinforcement, to provide a mechanism to maintain an already established pattern
     during growth.</p>

  <p>By careful adjustment of the parameters and the sequencing of operations, we closely match the appearance of a few
     real species. In particular, we reproduce in detail the distinctive features of the leopard skin, also providing a
     hypothesis for the simultaneous productions of the most common melanin types, eumelanin and pheomelanin.</p>
