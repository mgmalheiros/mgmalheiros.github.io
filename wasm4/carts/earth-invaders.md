# Earth Invaders

Inspired by the classic *Space Invaders*, except this time, Earth is the enemy. Destroy incoming ships, dodge bullets, and use your ultimate ability to obliterate everything.

Fast reflexes and smart timing are your best weapons. **Good luck, defender!**

## How to Play
* If an enemy bullet hits you, you **lose** a life.
* If an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen, you **lose** a life.
* You have **3 lives**. Lose all of them, and it's **game over**.
* Defeating an enemy increases your score by 1.
* Difficulty increases as you survive, up to a max at score 100.
