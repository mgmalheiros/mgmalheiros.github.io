# Comic Sans

Prepare for a relentless challenge in Comic-Sans, a fan-made survival game where every second counts, inspired by an iconic final battle.

## Gameplay & Instructions

Using the arrow keys, you will guide a lone SOUL through a storm of increasingly frantic attacks. What begins as a delicate dance between projectiles quickly becomes a true test of reflexes and endurance. Dodge through intricate patterns of scrolling bones, navigate the narrow gaps of deadly 'Flappy Bone' walls, and hold on through a final, high-speed onslaught.

Your only mission is to survive. Do you have what it takes to last until the end?

*This project was developed in Rust for the WASM-4 fantasy console by Computer Science students from UEM (State University of Maring√°), guided by their professor, Marcelo Malheiros.
